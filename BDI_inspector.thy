text \<open> This machine describes a nuclear radiation detection robot \<close>

text \<open> Some ideas for properties:
 - always believes going or believes arrived
 - never believes it is going to two different places \<close>

text \<open> The machine should implement the following plan:
goal_inspect(Location), location_coordinate(Location, X, Y), ~danger_red, ~danger_orange, ~going(door)
-(1)> +going(Location), -goal_inspect(Location), do(move(X, Y))

arrived, going(door) -(2)> -going(door), do(await_decontamination)
arrived, going(OldLocation), next_location(OldLocation, NewLocation)
-(1)> -going(OldLocation), +goal_inspect(NL), -arrived, do(inspect(OldLocation))
arrived, ~going(OldLocation) -(1)> -arrived, do(null)
move_failure -(1)> do(null)

danger_red, ~going(door), location(door, X, Y) -(2)> +going(door), move(X, Y)
danger_orange, ~going(door), location(door, X, Y) -(2)> +going(door), move(X, Y) ï»¿
